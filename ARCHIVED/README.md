## ARCHIVE NOTE
This version was archived on 09/14/25.
The project will be shifted to a multi-platform compatable version, rather than relying on Windows Forms exlusively.
The backbone of the project will remain the same (depot lookup, map logic, etc)
-------------------------

# ZipCodeSearch
This is a Windows Froms application that takes in zip code from user, parses through a list of depot locations and returns the nearest depot as well as the 'by-the-road' distance to that depot.

In order to build and run successfully on your machine, you will need to create your own app.config file containing an API key you obtain from OpenRouteService.

I will not be updating or maintaining this, so any bugs you find will remain unless I feel like coming back to this. Additionally, this was my first larger-scale C# project, so I am sure there are some things that I did that are considered "wrong" or "inefficient". Oh well...
